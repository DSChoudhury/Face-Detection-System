# Face Detection Using Harcascade and CV2
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc..Here in this project I used facial classifiers for detection of face of a person.
